Students:

Slender man
Popular for the sake of being popular. Hates his following, but won't admit it because he loves their attention. Generally polite to others.

Goatman
Soft spoken and quiet. Doesn't really have any friends. Has a speech impediment that makes him sound like an animal attempting to emulate human speech, and a nervous tic that causes jumpy and erratic movements. Prefers to embed himself into groups that don't know each-other, since he doesn't want to be a third wheel, but when he gets noticed, his tic and impediment shows through despite heavy therapy.

Grifter
Hipster asshole. Never around, but for some reason there are people always trying to find him, despite him not being very popular.

Skeleton Humerus
Total party animal and hedonist. Everybody loves him, but he dislikes most students, since they make fun of his lil' bro

Skeleton Jelly
THE BEST WAIFU

Zalgo
Some stupid OMG SO RANDUM kid who claims to have read the works of Lovecraft, but wouldn't know Cthulhu, even if he were to personally rise from R'lyeh and slap him.

Jeff the Killer
omg so edgi emo kid

Bloody Mary
Bubble-headed cheerleader type. Wants attention so bad, that all you have to do to get a date with her is call her name in front of a mirror a few times. People dislike her for how clingy she is, and her shrill voice.
